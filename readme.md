Rok my button pack, is a pack of buttons that once installed will display below your WYSIWYG editor and these buttons will allow you to easily with one click insert the code to insert rokbox compatible content.

Rok My Button requires RokBox. You can find RokBox and its download/usage information here at rocketwerx.com. Read More for more information and download link.


The four included plugin buttons are:
my audio
my remotesite
my remotethumb
my thumbnail
my video

This pack requires to be unzipped first and then uploaded one button at a time. The reason I did this was to allow users to only upload what they need.

Open Source, Modify as you wish.
